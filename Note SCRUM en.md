**Scrum™**

**Purpose of SCRUM**

- Develop complex products.
- Deliver complex products.
- Maintain complex products.

**Definition**: it is a framework where several processes and techniques are used.

**It is composed of:**

- Scrum Team and associated roles
- Events
- Artifacts
- Rules

**Improvement:** 

- Product
- Equipment
- Work Environment

**Uses:** 

- Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities.
- Develop products and enhancements.
- Launch products and enhancements, as often as many per day.
- Develop and maintain cloud (online, secure and on-demand) and other operating environments for product use. 
- environments for product use
- Maintain and renew products.

**Areas of action:** software, hardware, embedded software, interactive function networks, autonomous vehicles, schools, government, marketing, management of the functioning of organizations.

**SCRUM theory:** Scrum is based on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Scrum employs an iterative and incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. 

It has 3 pillars that underpin any application of empirical process control: 

- Transparency: Process visible to those responsible for the outcome.
- Inspection: They must inspect artifacts and sprint progress to detect undesirable variations.
- Adaptation: When deviating from acceptable limits, the process must be adjusted again.

**Scrum Events**

- Sprint Planning 
- Daily Scrum 
- Sprint Review 
- Sprint Retrospective

**SCRUM Process**

The SCRUM process can be divided into 3 parts:

1. ITERATION 
1. EXECUTION 
1. INSPECTION AND ADAPTATION 

**The following is a brief description of the process:**

Iteration planning is the first stage, and this in turn has two moments, in the first moment, the project managers meet with the customer, the customer presents the list of requirements and priorities. Based on the requirements, the two parties design the iterations and define the delivery deadlines.

` `After the first stage, we proceed to enter the sprint, which would be the second stage, the execution of the work team, daily meetings are held (which are 15 minutes maximum), to share the evolution of the designated tasks, obstacles that have been found during the execution, and in turn design possible adaptations or solutions to the failures found, the scrum-master ensures that his collaborators do not lower their productivity.

` `At the end of the sprint, we obtain a product that is potentially deployable in production. At this point, two types of meetings are considered: Sprint review and sprint retrospective. This would be our third stage inspection and adaptation; this stage takes place on the last day of the process. the team in charge of the product owner presents the results to the customer. Based on the list of priorities delivered in the first instance of the project, taking into account the changes in the context and the effectiveness of the results, the customer will decide if it is sufficient or if it should be adapted to new priorities; If the results are satisfactory, the team holds a last meeting to evaluate the process, which would give way to the sprint retrospective (three hours maximum) in this phase the Scrum Team analyzes its way of working, the objectives that were achieved and those that were not, the problems that hindered the project, customer feedback and more variables that can be changed to improve the work of the team and again enter the planning cycle of the sprint.

Scrum is an agile methodology process in which a series of good practices are applied to work as a team and minimize project risks. Its main advantages are increased productivity, quality, and constant monitoring of the project so that both workers and the customer can appreciate the progress.
